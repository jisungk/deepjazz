### Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation

I built [*deepjazz*](https://deepjazz.io) in 36 hours at a hackathon. It uses Keras & Theano, two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. Specifically, it builds a two-layer [LSTM](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html), learning from the given MIDI file. It uses deep learning, the AI tech that powers [Google's AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html) and [IBM's Watson](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is-watson.html), **to make music -- something that's considered as deeply human**.

### Dependencies

* [Keras](http://keras.io/#installation)
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#bleeding-edge-install-instructions) ("bleeding-edge" version on GitHub)
* [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/installing/index.html)

### Instructions

Run on CPU with command:  
```
python generator.py [# of epochs]
```

Run on GPU with command:  
```
THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python generator.py [# of epochs]
```

Note: running Keras/Theano on GPU is formally supported for only NVIDIA cards (CUDA backend).

Note: `preprocess.py` must be modified to work with other MIDI files (the relevant "melody" MIDI part needs to be selected). The ability to handle this natively is a planned feature.
